# Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics

- Inverse Kinematics is to determine a set of appropriate joint configurations for which the end effectors move to desired positions as smoothly, rapidly, and as accurately as possible.
- FABRIK describes that avoid the use of rotational angles or matrices, and instead finds each joint position via locating a point on a line. It converges in few iterations, has low computational cost and produces visually realistic poses.
